# MEAN Stack Authentication Project
This project is a simple MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack application that implements user sign-up and login with proper validations. The front end is developed using Angular with Angular Material for UI components, while the back end uses Node.js with Express.js. User authentication is handled using JWT for secure token management, and passwords are encrypted using the crypto-js package.
